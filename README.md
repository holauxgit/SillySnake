[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zonble/SillySnake.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zonble/SillySnake)

The project is just a simple personal practice for programming. It is
a remake of the classic video game "Snake" on iOS devicess, and it
only took me about only one hour.

To build the project, open ``SillySnake.xcodeproj`` and just click on
the "build" button. That is it!

This is just a simple game, but it is still fun! Make your own iOS
game today!
